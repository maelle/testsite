You could in theory experiment with your package, tinker with the code, submit it to R-hub again until the bug disappears but this would have a high turnaroud so is not optimal for debugging.

[You can debug locally for Linux platforms, with R-hub Docker containers](#docker-images), no matter your operating system, granted you were able to install Docker itself.

For other platforms that you do not have access to locally, you might need to [ask for help](#pkg-dev-help). And if you think the problem is due to R-hub rather than due to your package, [get in touch](#about-r-hub-in-particular).
