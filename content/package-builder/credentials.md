You can send your secret API key, token, etc. to R-hub package builder when using the [`rhub` package](https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/reference/index.html), via the `env_vars` argument of check functions.

You cannot do that with the web interface. See [more reasons to use the package rather than the web interface](#pkg-vs-web).
