> **R-hub is a collection of services to help R package development, free for all members of the community thanks to support from the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).**

Its most prominent service is the [*package builder*](#package-builder) that allows building and checking any R package on several platforms and R versions, with submission happening via a webform or an R client.

### What R-hub is not

* A replacement of CRAN
