R-hub supports the search of CRAN packages. This is different from [R-hub's support of code search _in_ CRAN packages](#cranatgh).

The search _of_ CRAN packages, e.g. find all CRAN packages related to GLMs, is powered by [R-hub search web service](https://github.com/metacran/search). R-hub also maintains an official R client, the [CRAN `pkgsearch` package](https://r-hub.github.io/pkgsearch/index.html).
